# Project 1a: Asphalt Art Project #1 - code.org

### Purpose 
Immersive Reader
Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. 
Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the `Painter`.

### Running this project
This project is meant to be run on the neighbourhood environment provided by [code.org](https://code.org/en-US).
I normally do not use Java, but this project was assignmed to me by my high school coding teacher. Therefore, I am just posting
the code here as a backup option.
